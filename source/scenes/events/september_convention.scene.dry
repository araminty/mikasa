@ban

The people are unhappy about free speech being silenced.  They blame both the corporations and the city government.


@permit

The academics steer clear of any anticorporate speech.  The largest impact of their discussion is greater awareness of the non-binary movement in Mikasa.  Nativist elements have been latching onto the non-binary academic tradition in recent years and are slightly encouraged by this convention even though most academics reject the nativist interpretations.,
